# c3lz
This is my workspace for converting c3l to z88dk. Once this is complete it will be moved to c3l project.

Assumes z88dk is in home dir. Use ./build.sh from scripts dir to build project.

I've noticed weird stuff about z88dk with memory management using the heap and stack. I'm working around that now.

Yeah, we're travelin' down that lonesome road
 Feel like I'm dragging a heavy load
 Don't try to turn my head away
 I'm flirtin' with disaster every day

And you are too, baby

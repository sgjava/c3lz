# c3lz
This is my workspace for converting c3l to z88dk. Once this is complete it will be moved to c3l project.

Assumes z88dk is in home dir. Use ./build.sh from scripts dir to build project.

I've noticed weird stuff about z88dk with memory management using the heap and stack. I'm working around that now.
